Movies Revenue Analysis Project
Introduction
This project explores trends in movie revenues using data from 2020-2021. The primary goals are:

To identify the most profitable genres.
To analyze how audience ratings correlate with revenue.
Using statistical and visualization techniques, insights were generated to help understand what makes a movie financially successful.

Data Preparation
The dataset comprises 10 movies, each described by the following attributes:

Title: Name of the movie.
Year: Year of release (2020 or 2021).
Genre: The movie’s genre (Action, Comedy, Drama, etc.).
Revenue: Total box office revenue (in millions).
Budget: Production budget (in millions).
Rating: Audience score on a 1-10 scale.
New Columns Added:
Profit Margin: A measure of profitability, calculated using the formula:
Profit Margin (%)
=
Revenue - Budget
Budget
×
100
Profit Margin (%)= 
Budget
Revenue - Budget
​
 ×100
The dataset was cleaned by:

Removing duplicate entries.
Handling missing values by substituting defaults or median values.
Analysis
The analysis provided the following key insights:

Most Profitable Genre:

Action emerged as the most profitable genre, achieving a 150% profit margin, driven by significant box office hits.
Highest Revenue Year:

2021 recorded the highest total revenue compared to 2020, attributed to multiple top-performing movies.
Correlation Between Ratings and Revenue:

A strong positive correlation of ~0.8 indicates that higher audience ratings tend to be associated with higher revenues.
Visualizations

Conclusion
The analysis offers key insights into the financial success of movies:

Action movies consistently generate the highest profitability.
Audience ratings play a significant role in determining box office performance.
These findings can guide production and marketing strategies, emphasizing genre choice and audience satisfaction.

Next Steps
Future directions for this project could include:

Expanding the Dataset: Incorporate more movies from additional years for a broader analysis.
Advanced Analytics: Use machine learning models to predict future movie revenues based on features like genre, budget, and ratings.Movies Revenue Analysis Project
